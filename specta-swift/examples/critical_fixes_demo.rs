/// Comprehensive demonstration of all critical fixes
/// 
/// This example shows how Specta Swift now properly handles:
/// - Duration fields (converted to TimeInterval)
/// - Tuple structs (converted to proper Swift structs)
/// - Multi-line documentation (properly formatted)
/// - Complex union types with nested structs
/// 
/// All of these previously generated malformed Swift code,
/// but now work correctly with idiomatic Swift output.

/// A struct with Duration fields that previously generated malformed code
/// 
/// Before the fix, this would generate:
/// ```swift
/// let totalDuration:     let secs: UInt64
/// let nanos: UInt32
/// ```
/// 
/// Now it generates:
/// ```swift
/// let totalDuration: TimeInterval
/// ```
